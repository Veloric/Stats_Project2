Final Thoughts:
Thanks for the semester, Professor. I learned a lot, even though it may not reflect on my grade. I can say with confidence that I believe I am a better workplace asset after taking this course, at least.
I ran out of time to do proper documentation of results, findings, and other interesting points about some of the project, but I hope what I did present, and write Java Doc about is enough.

Thanks,
